# Project Title : RAG using FAISS with LLM GooglePalm  (Langchain & Huggingface)
## Understanding the dataset
This project explores the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) , leveraging the power of FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) and Google PaLM, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) from Google AI. It utilizes the Langchain library for efficient retrieval and the Hugging Face Transformers library for seamless integration with PaLM.

2. Techniques and Algorithms used -

    1. FAISS integration: Enables efficient retrieval of relevant passages from a large corpus using FAISS's similarity search capabilities.
    2. Google PaLM: Exploits the advanced text generation abilities of PaLM to craft informative and coherent responses based on the retrieved passages.
    3. Langchain library: Provides a streamlined approach for incorporating retrieval into the RAG framework.
    4. Hugging Face Transformers: Offers a user-friendly interface for interacting with PaLM and other Transformers models.

3. Conclusions-

    This project successfully demonstrates the power of combining FAISS, Google PaLM, Langchain, and Hugging Face to create a robust RAG system. By effectively retrieving relevant information and leveraging advanced language generation, this model offers a promising approach to various natural language processing tasks.
